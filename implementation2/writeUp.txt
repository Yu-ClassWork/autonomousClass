For the second implementation I worked on implementing an MDP that used auctioning to help imporove results. I wanted to focus on the improvement of rewards and computational needs in my implementation instead of focus on creating a POMDP. This is why for my implementation I decided to do an MDP that I came up with and make the transition function 100%. To run my implementation all you have to do is type "python implementation2.py". This will run the implementation and produce 3 graphs and the 3 averages for each graph.
